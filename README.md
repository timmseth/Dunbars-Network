# Dunbars-Network
An alternative to massive social networks.

## Goal
Just making a "different" social networking site.

## What's Problem does it solve?
It fixes the biggest problem with most social networks. Too many people. 

I subscribe to the notion that most "Facebook Friends", "Twitter Followers", and "Instagram Stalkers" are not actual friends. 

In fact, I dont think its possible to maintain a "real relationship" with as many people as we pretend to.

## How many people is too many?
It's debatable. To keep things simple, we will be using [Dunbar's Number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar%27s_number) -- 150 by default.

### What is Dunbar's Number?
Read the [wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar%27s_number).

#### TLDR From The Article:
> "The number of people you would not feel embarrassed about joining uninvited for a drink if you happened to bump into them in a bar." - Robin Dunbar

#### Excerpt From The Wikipedia Article:
Dunbar's number is a suggested cognitive limit to the number of people with whom one can maintain stable social relationshipsâ€”relationships in which an individual knows who each person is and how each person relates to every other person.

This number was first proposed in the 1990s by British anthropologist Robin Dunbar, who found a correlation between primate brain size and average social group size.
By using the average human brain size and extrapolating from the results of primates, he proposed that humans can comfortably maintain 150 stable relationships.
There is some evidence that brain structure predicts the number of friends one has, though causality remains to be seen.

Proponents assert that numbers larger than this generally require more restrictive rules, laws, and enforced norms to maintain a stable, cohesive group. 
It has been proposed to lie between 100 and 250, with a commonly used value of 150.
